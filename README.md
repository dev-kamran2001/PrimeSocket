# PrimeSocket
Easy to use TCP and UDP Socket library for C and C++ supporting class callback methods, multi threading and SSL/TLS.

# How to build
## Windows
Just open the project file included in the project. At least Visual Studio 2019 is required.
#### Note: CMake will be used in future updates to support cross platform build.
## Linux
A work in progress

# Requirements
- Visual Studio 2019
- OpenSSL library (if you're planning to build with SslSocket enabled)

# Notes
- This project was not intended to be public open source so you may find the codes a little messy and unmanaged
- SslSocket class is a work in progress and not yet 100 percent finished. report issues if you found any
- RawSocket class is not currently usable and it's a work in prograss, has known issues and missing functions
- Support for linux is in progress
- Support the project if you want me to keep working on it and keep it updated
